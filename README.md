## esp32-audio-recorder Project by: Diana Cohen 
  
## Details about the project
* Web server on ESP32 serving a web page as GUI
* Option to upload audio files (MP3, WAV in different qualities) to local storage (SPIFFS)
* Store at least 3 files at once, and play any file, through the GUI
* Option to start recording from Microphone through GUI â€“ directly to local storage (SPIFFS)
* Ability to play the last recording, through the GUI - "recording.wav" appear on the list of audio files, and can be played/deleted
 
## Folder description
* Documentation: wiring diagram + basic operating instructions.
* ESP32: --deprecated. source code for the esp side (firmware). Unit tests are based on these files. 
* esp32-audio-recorder/src: the most updated .h files, replacing ESP32 content. note that secrets.h is ignored, you need to create your own with credentials.
* esp32-audio-recorder/data: the web server files (html+javascript+css).
* flutter_app: --irrelevant. dart code for Flutter app, but our project has none.
* Parameters: contains description of configurable parameters 
* Unit Tests: tests for individual hardware components (input / output devices).
* Assets: 3D printed parts, Audio files used in this project, different .mp3 and .wav files, which can be uploaded using esp32-audio-recorder and then played in-browser, while the .wav files can play on esp32
